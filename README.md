# Internship Finder & Tracker

Currently, the repository is segregated into two folders, one is frontend and one is backend. 

Both folders have separate README files to ensure that you are able to test for frontend and backend development. 

Frontend folder will consist mainly of HTML/CSS/JS files (Eventually migrating to Vue files) whereas Backend folder will consist mainly of JS files storing API calls & Firebase DB methods.
